Deploy Debian Stretch:

1.4
Build 1 & 2 used https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=4931 but has a timer bug + lack of support from developer.
Build 3 switched to Ayufan's build: https://github.com/ayufan-pine64/linux-build/releases

1.5
Build 1 Based on Ayufan's stretch-minimal-pine64-bspkernel-0.7.30-140.img.xz

-----------------------------

Username and Password: pine64

sudo su

Once booted from Ayufan's build and logged in as root, check if filesystem was successfully resized. If yes, continue. If not, run as root: sleep 600 && reboot

Ensure OS is fully up-to-date and is the version intended (eg., Buster instead of Stretch, Bionic instead of Xenial).

Set the timezone to America/Toronto: dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

Fix the time: wget -O - https://www.baldnerd.com/nerdgasms/linuxdate/ajax.php?tz=192 | { read gmt; date -s "$gmt"; }

Edit /etc/locale.gen and uncomment
- en_CA.UTF-8 UTF-8
- en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8

Run locale-gen

Prep as normal.

Build: /root/nems/nems-admin/nems-build.sh 40
