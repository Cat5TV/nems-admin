Deploy Debian Stretch:
Build 1 & 2 used https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=4931 but has a timer bug + lack of support from developer.
Build 3 switched to Ayufan's build: https://github.com/ayufan-pine64/linux-build/releases

Username and Password: pine64

sudo su

Once booted from Ayufan's build and logged in as root, run this and let it wait:
sleep 600 && reboot

Then let it sit a while (to ensure Ayufan's first boot scripts are complete).

Prep as normal.

Build: /root/nems/nems-admin/nems-build.sh 1.4.1 40

Set the timezone: dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

Fix the time: wget -O - https://www.baldnerd.com/nerdgasms/linuxdate/ajax.php?tz=192 | { read gmt; date -s "$gmt"; }

Edit /etc/locale.gen and uncomment en_CA.UTF-8 UTF-8

Run locale-gen

Reboot

Cleanup
