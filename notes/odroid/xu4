Verify the filesystem has been successfully resized ( df -h | grep mmcblk1p2). Distro includes a script at /root/scripts/first-boot that runs automatically at first boot via /etc/rc.local - but it doesn't always work.

Check filesystem space first, then prep NEMS as per normal.

Then build NEMS with:
/root/nems/nems-admin/nems-build.sh 11

Once SD card image is built, connect eMMC and prep with:
Run: nand-sata-install and choose "Update bootloader on a special eMMC partition"
